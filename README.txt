## Description
This is a simple project I made during my free time, the goal was just to try out python.
The script takes user input for a month and day and determines the corresponding season based on a simplified classification. The script considers months with 31 days, 30 days, and 29 days separately.

## Instructions

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the name of the month when prompted.
3. Enter the day of the month when prompted.
4. The script will output the corresponding season or "Invalid" if the input is not valid.
